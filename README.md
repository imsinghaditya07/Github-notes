## 🛠️ Quick Start: The "Big Three" Workflow

Most of your daily work in Git follows this simple loop:

```bash
# 1. Stay updated
git pull origin main

# 2. Do your work
git add .
git commit -m "feat: descriptive message about your change"

# 3. Share your work
git push origin your-branch-name
```

## 🎯 Pro Tips for Professionalism

*   **Atomic Commits:** Make small, logical commits. One commit = one task.
*   **Meaningful Messages:** Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add user auth" instead of "Added user auth").
*   **Branching Strategy:** Never work directly on `main`. Use feature branches.
*   **Pull Requests:** Always describe *what* changed and *why* in your PR descriptions.
