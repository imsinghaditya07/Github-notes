# ✨ GitHub Profile README: Your Developer Portfolio

Your GitHub profile is often the first thing recruiters and other developers see. A special repository allows you to add a `README.md` to your profile page.

---

## 🛠️ 1. How to Create It
1.  Create a **New Repository**.
2.  Name the repository **exactly the same as your GitHub username**.
    -   *Example:* If your username is `octocat`, name the repo `octocat`.
3.  GitHub will show a secret message: *"You found a secret! ...is a special repository..."*
4.  Check **"Initialize this repository with a README"**.
5.  Click **Create repository**.

## 🎨 2. What to Include?
Edit the `README.md` file in that repo. Whatever you put there shows up on your profile!

### Common Sections:
-   **Header:** A banner image or a "Hi there 👋" introduction.
-   **About Me:** What do you do? What are you learning?
-   **Tech Stack:** Use icons to show languages/frameworks you know.
-   **Stats:** Dynamic cards showing your commits/PRs (see tools below).
-   **Socials:** Links to LinkedIn, Twitter, Portfolio.
